#summary How to use the class (for version 1.02)

= Introduction =

It's fairly simple. Just initiate the class with the class parameter the html to be parsed and call {{{toArray()}}} function which will return the array.

= Details =

An easy example is this one:
{{{
$html = file_get_contents('http://www.google.com');
$parser = new htmlParser($html);
$ar = $parser->toArray();
var_dump($ar);
}}}

Before sending it to array you can also set the {{{$parser->ignoreSingleTags=true}}} if you want single tags (like img, meta and so on) to be ignored. 

One more function to be used is {{{loadNode($id)}}} which will load the html node with the parameter id.

And last but not least {{{getAllTags}}} which will return all the tags (with their child and everything), so if you want to search you don't have to recurse.
